description: Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

_Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._

Eventually, the plan is to be able to pick and choose from either React Aria Components or Radix UI Components.

## React Aria Components

[react-aria-components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/react-aria-components.html) is a library of unstyled React components that helps you build accessible, high quality UI components for your application or design system.

## Set-up

Setup requires you doing the shadcn-ui set-up to generate your tailwind config. You can find these instructions [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation)
